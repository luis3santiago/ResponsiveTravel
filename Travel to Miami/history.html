      <h2>How Miami Started</h2>
      <p class="para">Julia Tuttle purchased 640 acres of land near the Miami River in 1891.
        After this she tried to persuade Henry Flagler to expand his tain lines to this newly purchased area.
        He declined until a freeze destroyed almost all of the citrus crops. Julia's land was unaffected, leading Henry to
        write to Julia asking to look at her land. With that a city was planned along with a railroad.</p>
